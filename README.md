# UdaciFitness

This repository contains code featured in Udacity's React Nanodegree program.

But updated to latest libraries, and built step by step so I can show my mentees how the progress is done.

If you want to follow the [original repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-UdaciFitness-complete) feel free to check it

Feel free to follow along with the branches as shown in the classroom.
